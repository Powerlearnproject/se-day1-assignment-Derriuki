Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software application using structured language models.
This disciplince is essential to ensure that programs are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient in their various usage.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

1. The Software Crisis
     This period marked the beginning of a more structured and engineering based approach to software programming hence laying the foundation for methodologies that would improve       
     software reliability and maintainability.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming
      This era promoted encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, thus allowing developers to make software more modular, reusable, and scalable.
3. The rise of Agile Methodologies.
       This era revolutionised the industry by fostering flexibility, collaboration and iterative progress which in turn promoted productivity and software quality.
   
**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

1. Planning - Defines the project scope, objectives and determination of its feasibility.
2. Requirement Analysis - Determination and documentation of all stakeholders requirement is done at this stage.
3. Design - This phase focuses on designing the architecture and blueprint of the software.
4. Coding/Development/Implementation - The phase whereby Developers translate the design to a functional software by way of written code.
5. Testing - At this phase, Rigorous testing is done to ensure the software meets its requirements by identifying and eliminating bugs.
6. Deployment - At this juncture, the software is released to the various end-users.
7. Maintenance and support - Main objective of this stage is to ensure longevity of software usage by fixing bugs, updating, enhancing and monitoring the system.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

Waterfall methodologies employ a linear and sequential approach to software development meaning that one phase has to be complete before moving to the next one, however, Agile methodologies employ an iterative, collaborative and flexible approach to development.
The waterfall methodology is suitable for projects that have well defined and unchanging requirements such as banking software while Agile methodology is ideal for a dynamic and fast evolving project such as a social media app. 

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

_Software developer_
The individual is tasked with developing, designing and coding software solutions.

_Quality Assurance Engineer_
The individual is responsible for ensuring the quality of developed software matches with outlined requirements while also ensuring the resolution of any defects before deployment

_Project Manager_
This refers to the individual who oversees the development process from start to finish while ensuring the project is within the initial scope, budget and time constraints.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

Integrated Development EEnvironments such as Visual Studio Code provide developers with sets of tools for coding, testing and debugging within one interface while Version Control Systems such as Git help developers track and manage any changes to the source code over time.

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

1. Scope Creep - The needs of stakeholder are constantly evolving hence changes to software requirements. This can be mitigated by fostering open communication and managing expectations.
2. Rapid Technological Changes - Technology advances continuously thus developers may experience trouble keeping up and thereby having outdated skills. This can be managed by engaging in community forums that exposes the developer to the latest trends while also providing opportunities for continue upskilling.
3. Communication challenges- Software development often requires collaboration with other developers. Working in teams may present communication breakdown thus affecting project delivery. To avoid such scenarios, a clear communication channel should be established while also leveraging collaboration tools such as Slack.
4. Time Constraints - Developers are exposed to expectations of delivering within short periods of time which can lead to potentially compromised code while also risking stress and burnout on the developers. Effective time management and improved productivity considerably help in overcoming deadlines and time constraints.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

1. Unit Testing - This focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation which ensures individals work correctly and help in detecting bugs earlier.
2. Integration Testing - This focuses on testing how different components interact with each other thereby ensuring communication issues are detected early. 
3. System Testing - This focuses on testing the whole software to determine if it  performs optimally, is stable and secure hence ensuring it functions appropiately in a real world environment. 
4. Acceptance Testing - This test determines whether the software meets user expectations through their perspective and whether its ready for deployment thus ensuring user and business satisfaction while boosting stakeholders confidence in releasing the software.

**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

Prompt engineering refers to the science of effectively crafting well structured text inputs or queries for interactions with AI models such as Gemini. This ensures the AI models generate relevant, accurate and high quality responses.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

Vague Prompt - "Tell me about the building code"
Improved Prompt - "Provide a summary of the new building code introduced in Kenya and its poential impacts on the Kenyan construction industry."
The improved prompt is more effective since its concise and specific on which country to focus on while also outlining the task that should be performed.
